								and spectroscopic observations with SPS modeling codes to derive the star formation histories (what the cartoon shows). More to come for the results of this work.... ;)

								Characterization of gas rich 'Buddy Galaxies' found within the SQuIGGLE survey. In this work, I detected gas-rich galaxies that neighbor PSBs in CO(2-1) measurements from ALMA.
								With these detections I combined photometry from the HSC and DECaLS survey with Bagpipes and Prospector to model the star formation histories of these galaxies. Additionally, I compared my findings 
								with the UniverseMachine to see how common it is for PSBs to have a buddy.

								<br> STEPUP (Study of Transiting Extra-Solar Planets at the University of Pittsburgh) is a research group that 
									 takes data using the 24" and 16" Keeler telescopes at the Allegheny Observatory to 
									collect data on known and candidate exoplanets for the TESS and ExoplanetWatch projects. I was the leader of this group
									which gave me the opportunity to teach undergradute students about time-domain astronomy, data reduction, and 
								how to make sense of our findings. Additionally, as the lead, I was given the opportunity to do a lot of outreach for the Allegheny Observatory.
